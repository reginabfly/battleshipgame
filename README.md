# Battleship Game

This battleship game was built utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## About The Game

This game is a simple application that allows you to play battleship on your computer just like you would on the actual game. At the bottom of the screen, you type in your guess with lowercase letters. An example would be "a6" and the game will tell you if you got a hit or a miss. There are three ships you need to sink on the board to win the game.
